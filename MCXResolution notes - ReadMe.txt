Developers designed menu on 640x480 size. That is the reason for game menu being
smaller and on the top left corner of the screen when you choose higher resolutions.

The Ingame-In-Mission fullscreen will be in the resolution you have chosen.

- not all resolution.exe files are working on any monitors, you have to find the one that suites you fine
- do not choose a resolution higher than your current desktop resolution
- HD Resolutions like 1950x1080 are to be seen as testing resolutions, they are not stable
- most stable resolutions i have encountered are between 1024x768 and 1440x900

In order to start game mount the MCGold.iso file into your virtual drive and start
resolution.exe file.
