6. Mission Editor Troubleshooting
=============================================

Color Depth and Display Area

MechComander Desperate Measures and the Mission 
Editor display correctly with a 256 or higher color 
palette and a 640 x 480 display area. We recommend 
using a 16-bit (high) color palette and a display area 
greater than 800 x 600.


Speeding Up Low Frame Rate

If you are getting a low frame rate when you play a mission 
you've created, try the following:

1. Ensure that enemy 'Mechs don't have move paths into 
unreachable areas--for example, a base with no gate.
2. Ensure that enemy patrol paths have staggered time 
delays so they are not all triggering simultaneously.
3. Delete the number of individual trees on the map.
4. Delete the number of forest tiles on the map.
5. Replace a few nonobjective critical enemy 'Mechs 
with tanks.
