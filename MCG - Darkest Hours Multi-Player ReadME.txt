In order to play MechCommander online nowadays after MS Zone and battletech stopped hosting servers you can not
use the Ingame-Multiplayer functions without a sub program helping MechCommander Gold.

You can, of course use the ingame Multi-Player functions in your private network via LAN / Serial options that
game has to offer. The global multi-player function based on an external server network with a special web client
for mechcommander. This client supports IPX/SPX-Protocol based (old / retro) games. It is called GameRanger.

Here you can download gameranger for free. It uses low system capacities and simulates a private network for
gaming via Internet. Gameranger not only supports MechCommander, but also a mass of old retro games for nowaday
uses. Some more examples of games that can be played with gameranger support are AgeOfEmpires, Command&Conquer
series & many more.

After downloading and installing gameranger it might ask you to install flashplayer too, this program is a windows
tool that needs to be installed in order to get gameranger running. When this is passed you are able to start
gameranger. After finishing the registration process and basic settings gameranger asks for start to experience
gameranger a bit. On the top left it guides you through its single functions. In options search for MechCommander
Gold - Desperate Measures - choose MCG.

gamefolders MCX.exe. The path you give gameranger for game exe file should look this way:
