DIFFICULTY LEVELS
-----------------

MechCommander Desperate Measures offers three levels 
of gameplay: easy, regular, and hard. These 
levels can also be used to play the original 
MechCommander missions.

To set the difficulty level
1. On the MechCommander Desperate Measures main menu, 
click Preferences.
2. Under Difficulty, click Easy, Regular, or Hard.

Note: You can change the difficulty level before you 
start a mission or between missions. If a mission proves 
to be too challenging, you can lower the difficulty 
setting, win the mission, and then return to the former 
difficulty setting for the next mission.


WAYPOINTS
---------

Waypoints give a commander greater control over his 
units’ movement by setting a specific series of points 
for them to automatically follow, thus freeing up the 
commander’s attention for other units. There are four 
different types of waypoints--walk, run, jump, and 
minelayer--and you can place a total of 16 waypoints 
in any order.

Units traverse waypoints by the shortest possible move 
path. For example, if cliffs are directly between two 
waypoints, the units must move around the cliffs. 
Therefore, by placing more waypoints, you gain more 
control of the move path. For example, you may have a 
jump-capable unit walk to the first waypoint, run 
to the second, jump to the third, and run to the fourth.

To create waypoints
1. To create a walk waypoint, press and hold CTRL, or 
F9, while you click the waypoint location on the main 
screen.
   -or-
   To create a run waypoint, press and hold CTRL+SPACEBAR, 
or F10, while you click the waypoint location on the 
main screen.
   -or-
   To create a jump waypoint, press and hold CTRL+J, or 
F11, while you click the waypoint location on the main 
screen.
   -or-
   To create a Minelayer waypoint (mines are laid as the 
vehicle follows the move path), press and hold CTRL+F while 
you click the waypoint location on the main screen.
2. Repeat step 1 as necessary.

Notes
* You can assign a move path to any number of units at 
one time, using the standard selection methods. If a 
group of units is selected, the lead unit will move to 
the waypoints first.
* You can view a unit’s move path lines by pressing and 
holding CTRL.
* You can add waypoints to an existing move path at any 
time. The new waypoints are added to the end of the 
orders queue.
* You can clear a unit’s move path by selecting that 
unit and pressing BACKSPACE.
* Waypoints may be placed in unrevealed terrain; they 
appear above the black background, similar to sensor 
traces.
* You can place waypoint markers while the mission is 
paused. Once a waypoint marker is laid, it cannot be 
moved. Units will begin following their move paths when 
the mission is resumed. This is helpful in organizing 
simultaneous movement.
* While CTRL is pressed, you cannot assign targets or 
capture a unit.
* If a unit following a move path receives a new order, 
movement, or attack, the move path and its waypoints are 
canceled.
* If attacked while executing a walk waypoint, the units 
behave identically to units walking in MechCommander. 
They will stray off their move path until the combat is 
resolved.
* If a unit cannot reach a given waypoint, it will 
behave identically to a unit that cannot handle a move 
order.
* To set a move path through burned forest, place 
waypoints just before the burned forest, just after 
the burned forest, and then toward your final 
destination.
* You may play the original MechCommander campaign using 
waypoints.


AMMO CONSERVATION FIRE
----------------------

To give the commander greater control over his resources 
in combat, he can order units to fire energy weapons only, 
conserving precious ammunition until it is truly needed.

Energy weapons are those with an unlimited supply of 
shots--for example, Pulse Lasers, Heavy Flamers, and 
Particle Projector Cannons. Ammo weapons are those that 
fire a limited supply of shots or salvos--for example, 
Gauss Rifles, Autocannons, and Missile Packs.

To order ammo conservation mode
* Hold down A and then, on the main screen, click the 
enemy you want to hit with energy weapons only. The 
cross hairs will appear orange.

Notes
* To clear all orders, including ammo conservation mode, 
press BACKSPACE.
* If a unit in ammo conservation mode receives a new 
attack order, ammo conservation mode is canceled and the 
unit will fire all of its weapons.
* If a unit has only ammo weapons and is given the ammo 
conservation mode order, that unit will not fire (as if 
it were out of weapons).
* A commander orders a group of units to use ammo 
conservation mode in the same manner he would make any 
other order. If one of the units in the group has only 
ammo weapons, then that unit will not fire (as if it 
were out of weapons).
* You may play the original MechCommander campaign using 
ammo conservation fire.


FIRE SUPPORT HOTKEYS
--------------------

Fire support gives the commander greater control over his 
combat resources. Launch small artillery strikes, large 
artillery strikes, sensor probes, and camera drones by 
pressing a key on the keyboard (not the numeric keypad) 
and clicking the mouse on the target--no wasting time 
moving the cursor to the multifunctional display (MFD).

While a fire support hotkey is depressed, its 
corresponding button is highlighted on the MFD, per the 
RUN, JUMP, and GUARD hotkeys in original MechCommander. 
The fire support cursor may be moved until the hotkey is 
activated by clicking the left mouse button.

To                              Press
---------------------------     ----------------------
Drop small artillery strike	1+Left mouse button on 
at cursor                       target
Drop large artillery strike	2+Left mouse button on
at cursor                       target
Drop sensor probe at cursor	3+Left mouse button on 
                                target
Drop camera drone at cursor	4+Left mouse button on 
                                target

Note: You must press a number key each time you want to 
drop artillery and so forth. For example, to drop three 
small artillery strikes, you must press 1 and click the 
left mouse button once on each of the targets.

5. TROUBLESHOOTING
==================

In the Mission Editor, the "Capture Units" objective
applies only to non-combat units.

In the Mission Editor, the help screens for the Main
Toolbar and the Standard Toolbar are switched.

Avoid ALT+TAB: After pressing ALT+TAB to leave the 
application and then return to it, you may have problems 
such as the game hanging. To avoid this problem, do not 
press ALT+TAB.

DdHelp Errors: Running other applications in the 
background while running MechCommander Desperate Measures 
may cause DdHelp errors. Be sure to close all other 
applications before starting MechCommander Desperate 
Measures.

Check with your video card manufacturer to make sure that 
your video card drivers are the most current.

If your operating system is Microsoft Windows 95 
(the Gold version) and you have a version of Internet 
Explorer that is earlier than version 3.1, a fatal error 
message may appear when you start Mission Editor. 
You will need to install the latest version of Internet 
Explorer from http://www.microsoft.com/.

If your primary video display device is a Diamond Stealth 
3D 2000, when you first launch MechCommander Desperate 
Measures you may experience a crash back to your desktop. 
If this occurs, connect to the Diamond Web site 
(http://www.diamondmm.com/products/drivers/driver-index.html) 
and upgrade your video driver to version 4.10.1.69 to 
fix this problem.

If your primary video driver is a Creative Labs Graphics 
Blaster Exxtreme and you repeatedly use ALT+TAB to 
minimize the game, odd virtual screen behavior with both 
the Windows desktop and game screen may occur. If this 
occurs, connect to the Creative Labs Web site 
(http://support.soundblaster.com/files/download.asp) and 
upgrade your video driver to version 4.10.1.2111 to fix this 
problem.
